"""
The module sweepers exports the definition of sweep homotopies and
the tracking of solution paths defined by sweep homotopies.
A sweep homotopy is a polynomial system where some of the variables
are considered as parameters.  Given solutions for some parameters
and new values for the parameters, we can track the solution paths
starting at the given solutions and ending at the new solutions for
the new values of the parameters.
The sweep is controlled by a convex linear combination between the
list of start and target values for the parameters.
We distinguish between a complex and a real sweep.
In a complex sweep, with a randomly generated gamma we avoid singularities
along the solution paths, in a complex convex combination between the
start and target values for the parameters.  This complex sweep is
applicable only when the parameter space is convex.
