examples of phcpy

This directory is new in release 2.3.89 of PHCpack.
The purpose of this directory is to store Python modules that illustrate
and test the use of the capabilities of phcpy.
While not strictly part of the phcpy core distribution, the goal of this
directory is to document the development process, with regression tests,
and to collect use cases with applications.
