the circle problem of Appolonius
================================

The circle problem of Appolonius asks to find all circles tangent
to three given circles.  
In :numref:`figappolgeneral`,
the input circles are shown as blue disks and the eight circles
tangent to the three input circles are displayed in red.

.. _figappolgeneral:

    :align: center

    A general configuration of the circle problem of Appolonius.

This problem can be reformulated into that
of solving eight polynomial systems.  The number eight equals
the number of solutions to this problem.
The plots are generated with version 1.5.1 of ``matplotlib``.

a general configuration
-----------------------

Without loss of generality, we may fix the first given circle on input
as the unit circle, centered at the origin and with radius one.
We may fix the coordinate system so that the center of the second given
circle on input lies on the first coordinate axis.  Then we have two
parameters for the second circle: its *x*-coordinate :math:`b_x` of 
the center and its radius :math:`r_2`.
The remaining three parameters of this problem are the
two coordinates of the third circle on input,
:math:`c_x` and :math:`c_y`, and its radius :math:`r_3`.

There are thus five parameters in the input of this problem:

1. :math:`b_x`: the *x*-coordinate of the center of the second circle,
2. :math:`r_2`: the radius of the second circle,
3. :math:`c_x`: the *x*-coordinate of the center of the third circle,
4. :math:`c_y`: the *y*-coordinate of the center of the third circle,
5. :math:`r_3`: the radius of the third circle.

The conditions on the coordinates *x* and *y* and the radius *r*
of the circles tangent to the three given circles are expressed
in the following three polynomial equations:

.. math::

   x^2 + y^2 - (r \pm 1)^2 = 0 \\
   (x - b_x)^2 + y^2 - (r \pm r_2)^2 = 0 \\
   (x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2 - (r \pm r_3)^2 = 0

where the :math:`\pm` indicates that the distance of the center of
the touching circle to a given circle is either the sum or the
difference of the radii of the circles.  Choosing one :math:`+`
or one :math:`-` for the :math:`\pm` in each equation gives one
polynomial system.  Making all combinations of the :math:`\pm`
gives eight polynomial systems to solve.  Of course, only those
real solutions with positive radius are valid solutions.
Polynomials are represented as strings as in the following function:

::

   def polynomials(c2x, r2, c3x, c3y, r3):
       """
       On input are the five parameters of the circle problem of Appolonius:
       c2x : the x-coordinate of the center of the second circle,

       c3x : the x-coordinate of the center of the third circle,
       c3y : the y-coordinate of the center of the third circle,
       r3 : the radius of the third circle.
       Returns a list of lists.  Each list contains a polynomial system.

       of a circle touching three given circles.

The code for the function ``solve4circles`` has two important statements:

1. ``sols = solve(eqs, silent=True)`` calls the blackbox solver; and

2. ``soldic = strsol2dict(sol)`` converts a solution string ``sol``
   into the dictionary ``soldic``.

The ``solve`` takes on input a list of strings.  Each string represents
a polynomial in several variables.  What is returned by ``solve`` is
a list of string representations of solutions.  
The function ``strsol2dict`` takes on input a string representation
of a solution and returns a dictionary.  The keys contain the names
of the variables and the corresponding values are complex numbers,
with the coordinates of the solution.

Solving then a general configuration of three circles with centers
at :math:`(0, 0)`, :math:`(2, 0)`, :math:`(1, 1)`, with corresponding
radii :math:`1`, :math:`2/3`, and :math:`1/3` happens by two function calls:

::

    syst = polynomials(2, 2.0/3, 1, 1, 1.0/3)
    sols = solve4circles(syst)

a special configuration
-----------------------

A special configuration of the input circles is when they
mutually touch each other, as shown in :numref:`figappolspecial`.

.. _figappolspecial:

.. figure:: ./appolfig2.png
    :align: center

    A special configuration of the circle problem of Appolonius.

The five input parameters for this special configuration are
listed in the tuple :math:`(2, 1, 1, \sqrt{3}, 1)`.
The radius of each circle equals one.  The second circle has
its center at :math:`(2, 0)` and the center for the third circle
is at :math:`(1, \sqrt{3})`.

In this special configuration we see only five red circles,
three of which are equal to the given circles.
The three given circles count as double solutions to the problem.

We can see the multiplicity of the solutions with the following
session in an interactive Python shell:

::

   from math import sqrt
   h = sqrt(3)
   p = polynomials(2, 1, 1, h, 1)
   sols = solve(p[3], silent=True)
   print(sols[0])

In what is printed, we recognize the first input circle:

::

   t :  1.00000000000000E+00   3.32383584047048E+00
   m : 2
   the solution for t :
    x :  1.14316415930020E-16   1.64667010245109E-32
    y : -7.69185074553423E-17   1.14303942199382E-31
    r :  1.00000000000000E+00  -6.42297636453143E-32
   == err :  3.298E-16 = rco :  1.004E-17 = res :  2.625E-17 =

Observe the ``m : 2`` which indicates the multiplicity of the solution.

a perturbed configuration
-------------------------

To see why we have to count some solutions of the special
configuration twice, consider :numref:`figappolperturbed`

.. _figappolperturbed:

.. figure:: ./appolfig3.png
    :align: center

    A perturbed configuration of the circle problem of Appolonius.

The five input parameters for this perturbed problem are
listed in the tuple :math:`(2.05, 1, 1.025, \sqrt{3} + 0.025, 1)`.
Each circle still has radius one, but the input circles no longer
touch each other.

In an interactive Python shell, we may compute the solutions
as follows:

::

   from math import sqrt
   h = sqrt(3)
   p = polynomials(2.05, 1, 1.025, h+0.025, 1)
   sols = solve(p[3], silent=True)
   print(sols[0])

What is printed defines the large perturbation of the unit circle:

::

   t :  1.00000000000000E+00   5.00522372103966E+00
   m : 1
   the solution for t :
    x : -3.09008334843067E-01  -2.43642416382302E-114
    y : -1.98660887619915E-01  -1.37048859215045E-114
    r :  1.36735854321414E+00   2.43642416382302E-114
   == err :  3.322E-16 = rco :  5.942E-03 = res :  1.388E-15 =

The script ``appolonius.py`` in the source code distribution in
the ``examples`` folder of ``PHCpy2`` or ``PHCpy3`` is a self contained
script which solves the three instances of the problem of Appolonius.
