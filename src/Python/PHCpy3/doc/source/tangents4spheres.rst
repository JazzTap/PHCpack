all lines tangent to four spheres
=================================

The problem is to find all lines that are tangent to four spheres.
In :numref:`figtangents4`,
the special case is shown where the four spheres are mutually
touching each other.  In this case, a tangent line goes from one pair
of touching spheres to another, opposite pair of touching spheres.

    Four mutually touching spheres and their common tangent lines.

Solving the polynomial system associated with the configuration
in :numref:`figtangents4` shows that each tangent line occurs
with multiplicity four.  Counting with multiplicities,
the number of tangent lines thus equals twelve.

four mutually touching spheres
------------------------------

The centers of the four mutually touching spheres in :numref:`figtangents4`
are :math:`(+1, +1, +1)`, :math:`(+1, -1, -1)`, :math:`(-1, +1, -1)`,
:math:`(-1, -1, +1)`, and the radius is the same for all 
four spheres: :math:`\sqrt{2}`.

The tangent lines are defined by a moment vector 
:math:`{\bf m} = (x_0, x_1, x_2)`
and a tangent vector :math:`{\bf t} = (x_3, x_4, x_5)`.
The moment vector :math:`\bf m` 
is perpendicular to the tangent vector :math:`\bf t`,
which gives the first equation: :math:`x_0 x_3 + x_1 x_4 + x_2 x_5 = 0`.
The tangent vector is normalized: :math:`||{\bf t}||_2 = 1`,
which gives the second equation :math:`x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 1`.
For each center :math:`\bf c` and radius :math:`r` of a sphere,
the equation is

.. math::

   ({\bf m} - {\bf c} \times {\bf t})
   \cdot ({\bf m} - {\bf c} \times {\bf t}) - r^2 = 0,

where :math:`\times` is the cross product
and where :math:`\cdot` is the dot product
So we end up with a polynomial system of six equations in six unknowns.

The code in Sage to generate the polynomial system is below:

::

    x0, x1, x2 = var('x0, x1, x2')
    t = (x0, x1, x2) 
    vt = vector(t)   # tangent vector
    normt = vt.dot_product(vt) - 1
    x3, x4, x5 = var('x3, x4, x5')
    m = (x3, x4, x5)
    vm = vector(m)   # moment vector
    momt = vt.dot_product(vm)
    eqs = [normt, momt]
    for (ctr, rad) in zip(centers, radii):
        print 'the center :', ctr
        vc = vector(ctr)
        left = vm - vc.cross_product(vt)
        equ = left.dot_product(left) - rad**2
        eqs.append(equ)

Then the input system for the blackbox solver of phcpy is
the list of the string representations of the polynomials in ``eqs``.

::

    polsys = []
    for equ in eqs:
        pol = str(equ) + ';'
        polsys.append(pol)

Calling the blackbox solver then happens as

::

    from phcpy.solver import solve
    sols = solve(pols, silent=True)
    for sol in sols:
        print sol

and we see the multiplicity four solutions printed.
