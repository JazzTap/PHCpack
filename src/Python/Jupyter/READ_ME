The file custom.js in this folder defines the menu PHCpy in the notebook
extension for the Jupyter notebook running sage.

The file custom.js should be placed in the .jupyter/custom folder
and the jupyter_contrib_nbextensions must be installed
and the extension snippets_menu must be enabled.

The first version of the file custom.js was written by Jasmine Otto
in the summer of 2017.
