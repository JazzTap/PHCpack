The file custom.js in this folder defines the menu PHCpy in the notebook
extension for the Jupyter notebook running SageMath.

The file custom.js should be placed in the .jupyter/custom folder
and the jupyter_contrib_nbextensions must be installed
and the extension snippets_menu must be enabled.

The first version of the file custom.js was written by Jasmine Otto
in the summer of 2017.

Note that the code snippets are for Python 2, as this is still the
default version of Python in SageMath.
