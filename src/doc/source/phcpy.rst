An Application Programming Interface to PHCpack
===============================================

Because code development on PHCpack has taken a very long time,
looking at the code may be a bit too overwhelming at first.
A good starting point could be the Python interface
and in particular phcpy, with documentation at
<http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/phcpy_doc_html/index.html>.
