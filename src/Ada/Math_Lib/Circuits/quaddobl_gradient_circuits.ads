-- DESCRIPTION :
--   An arithmetic circuit to evaluate and differentate a polynomial
--   in several variables is defined as a tuple of coefficients,
--   common factors, and positions of the variables in the products.
--   The coefficients are complex, of quad double precision.
--   A circuit to evaluate and differentiate a polynomial system is
--   a tuple of circuits to evaluate and differentiatie polynomials.
--   The purpose of this package is to bundle the different data
--   that defines a circuit into one single record.

  --   The function wraps the procedure EvalDiff and may not be as
  --   efficient for repeated many point evaluations as the work space is
