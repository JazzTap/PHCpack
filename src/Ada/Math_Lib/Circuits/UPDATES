Fri 19 Jun 2015 : in standard_gradient_evaluations, added functions and
  procedures in case there are no common factors.
  New package standard_gradient_circuits encapsulates evaluation
  and differentiation, tested by ts_gradcirc.
  Extended {dobldobl,quaddobl,multprec}_gradient_evaluations also with
  routines for when there are no common factors.
  New package dobldobl_gradient_circuits, tested by ts_gradcirc.

Thu 18 Jun 2015 : factored split_common_factors out of the different
  gradient_evaluations packages into coefficient_supported_polynomials,
  which also changed the *jacobian_evaluations.adb files.
  Provided an extended version of split_common_factors.

Wed 17 Jun 2015 : new directory populated with code from ../Functions.
