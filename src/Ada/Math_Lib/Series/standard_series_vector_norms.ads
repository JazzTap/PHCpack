package Standard_Series_Vector_Norms is

-- DESCRIPTION :
--   The norm of a vector of series with complex coefficients is defined
--   via the inner product of the conjugate vector.

  function Conjugate ( v : Vector ) return Vector;

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   Returns the vector where every entry is the conjugate
  --   of the corresponding entry in v.

  function Inner_Product ( u,v : Vector ) return Series;

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   Returns the inner product of the conjugate of u with v.

  function Square_of_Norm ( v : Vector ) return Series;

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   Returns the inner product of the conjugate of v with v.
  --   This defines the square of the norm of the vector.
