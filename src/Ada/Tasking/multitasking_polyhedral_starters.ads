package Multitasking_Polyhedral_Starters is

-- DESCRIPTION :
--   This package provides procedures to solve all start systems with
--   multithreading (shared memory parallel computing) as used in
--   polyhedral homotopies.  These solvers are written in preparation 
--   for the actual polyhedral path trackers to verify whether all
--   start systems are solved correctly.

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   Solves the start systems of q defined by the mixed cells in mcc,
  --   using nt threads of execution.  The silent version does not
  --   write intermediate output to screen, which the reporting one does.

  -- REQUIRED : the order of the polynomials in the start system must
  --   agree with the order of the supports in the cells, and
  --   sols is an array of range 1..nt = res'range.

  -- ON ENTRY :
  --   nt       the number of tasks;
  --   q        a random coefficient start system;
  --   r        number of distinct supports;
  --   mix      type of mixture;
  --   mcc      a regular mixed-cell configuration.

  -- ON RETURN :
  --   mixvol   sum of the mixed volumes of the cells in mcc;
  --   sols     the start solutions computed by the tasks,
  --            in particular sols(i) is computed by task i,
  --            following a static workload assignment.
  --   res      res(i) contains the sums of all residuals of
  --            the start solutions computed by task i.
