-- DESCRIPTION :
--   Linear and nonlinear reduction to reduce the total degree.

  function Total_Degree
             ( p : Standard_Complex_Poly_Systems.Poly_Sys ) return natural32;

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   Returns the total degree of the polynomial system,
  --   i.e. the product of the degrees of the polynomials.

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   This procedure tries to lower the total degree of p by means
  --   of linear reduction, in standard double, double double, or
  --   quad double precision.

  -- ON ENTRY : 
  --   p             a polynomial system.

  -- ON RETURN :
  --   p             a polynomial system with a possible lower total degree;
  --   diagonal      true if all leading terms in p are different;
  --   inconsistent  is true if the reduced system has equations `4=0';
  --   infinite      is true if some equations of the original system
  --                 disappeared during the reduction process.

  --   by means of nonlinear reduction. 

  -- REQUIRED : the counters must equal 0, on entry.

  -- ON ENTRY :
  --   p             a polynomial system;

  --   cnt_rp        counts the number of R-polynomial computations;
  --   max_rp        limit on the number of R-polynomial computations.
