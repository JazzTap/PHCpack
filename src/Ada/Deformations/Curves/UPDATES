Tue 28 Jun 2016 : in _newton_series.adb, for QR_Newton, also write the
  result of the polynomial evaluation at the start.

Mon 27 Jun 2016 : new packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_newton_series for double
  double and quad double Newton on series, tested by ts_sernew.

Fri 24 Jun 2016 : added QR Newton to standard_newton_series,
  with added tests in ts_sernew.

Tue 21 Jun 2016 : updated standard_newton_series with many steps,
  tested by ts_sernew.

Mon 20 Jun 2016 : new packages standard_newton_series, tested by ts_sernew.

Wed 7 Oct 2015 : fixed call to silent root refiners in ts_extrapts for
  double double and quad double precisin.

Mon 21 Sep 2015 : extended black_box_univariate_solvers with routines in
  double double and quad double precision.

Thu 28 Aug 2013 : extended black_box_univariate_solvers with routines to
  solving univariate Laurent polynomials with multiprecision arithmetic.
  Exported more routines for the C to PHCpack interface.

Sat 30 Nov 2013 : updated black_box_univariate_solvers.a*,
  sample_plane_curves.a*, ts_extrapol.adb and ts_extrapts for multiprecision.

Fri 29 Nov 2013 : changed sample_plane_curves.adb and ts_extrapol.adb
  in search for a bug that turned out to be in the copy of lists in
  multprec_complex_solutions.adb.

Thu 28 Nov 2013 : higher-order predictors in multiprecision arithmetic
  in a new package multprec_extrapolators, and for testing purposes,
  updated sample_plane_curves, multprec_durand_kerner, ts_extrapol, and
  black_box_univariate_solvers.

Mon 10 Jun 2013 : all files in this directory changed because of the
  new types natural32 and integer32.

Tue 14 May 2013 : new directory with code from Root_Counts/Implift 
  and ../Trackers.  New package sample_plane_curves, with updates in
  ts_extrapol and a new ts_extrapts.
