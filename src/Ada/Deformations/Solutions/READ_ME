Solutions of systems and homotopies in PHCv2.4.01

The second release introduced the solution vectors with multiprecision.
Version 2.3 has an improved Maple interface.
Utilities to build frequency tables for solutions were added in version 2.3,
which became part of the main phc -v validation module in release v2.3.07
and upgraded with quad trees in v2.3.10.
Double double and quad double solutions were introduced in v2.3.55.

There are three parts in this library:
(1) definition of solutions with standard, double double, quad double,
    general multiprecision, their input/output, and string conversions;
(2) solution filters, as available in option #0 of phc -f;
(3) various utilities to manipulate solutions.

The standard and multiprecision solutions lists are two separate packages,
not implemented by means of generics, because of the difficulties with
mixed real-complex numbers.

Note: some little tools have been added to manipulate lists of solutions.
