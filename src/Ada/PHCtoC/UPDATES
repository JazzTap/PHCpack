Tue 1 Jul 2014 : renaming of files, separating ts_cpu from ts_gpu and
  using the ts_ only for the Ada main test programs, not for the C code.
  Made double double and quad double interfaces for random vector
  generated by Ada and 2-norm computed by the GPU.

Tue 18 Feb 2014 : renamed ts_gpu2norm_in_c.c into ts_gpu2norm_d_in_c.c
  and ts_gpu2norm.adb into ts_gpu2norm_d.adb to distinguish between the
  new double double and quad double versions.

Mon 17 Feb 2014 : callGPUnorm.cpp succeeds in having the GPU compute the
  2-norm, as called by ts_gpu2norm_Cmain.c.  Calling the GPU from an Ada
  main program works as well as is done in ts_gpu2norm_call.adb.

Thu 13 Feb 2014 : first programs ts_gpu2norm and ts_gpu2norm_in_c rely on
  the first CtoPHC/Funky interface.
