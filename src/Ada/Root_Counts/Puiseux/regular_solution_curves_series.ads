package Regular_Solution_Curves_Series is

-- DESCRIPTION :
--   A solution curve is regular if the following three conditions are met:
--   (1) the defining polynomial equations form a complete intersection,
--   in particular: the n polynomials in n+1 variables define curves as
--   the only solutions; there are no higher dimensional solutios;
--   (2) the system is in Noether position: there are no solution curves
--   contained in hyperplanes perpendicular to coordinate axes;
--   (3) the initial form solutions are regular, no multiple solutions.
--   The operations in this package compute series developments for such
--   regular solution curves of Laurent systems.
