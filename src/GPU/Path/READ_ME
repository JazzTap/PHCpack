Accelerated Path Tracking in the software package PHCv2.4.34

The code is developed on the NVIDIA K20C with g++ and the CUDA SDK.
It requires the QD and the GQD libraries.

The subdirectories, in alphabetical order are as follows:

bin           : for standalone binaries, apart from the PHCv2/bin
Complex       : tempated C++ code for complex arithmetic
Objects       : contains makefiles and .o files
DefineTypesD  : headers specific for double precision
DefineTypesDD : headers specific for double double precision
DefineTypesQD : headers specific for quad double precision
Host          : revised Path_CPU with proper templated code
Main          : main programs
Path_CPU      : path tracking on the host, the CPU
Path_GPU      : path tracking on the device, the GPU
Poly          : defines data structures for polynomials
Poly2         : revised Poly with proper templated code
Test          : code to link with PHClib

The standalone binaries are designed for benchmarking purposes
and work in several modes.

The library was first released in version 2.3.99 of PHCpack,
and made accessible in version 0.2.9 of phcpy.
Currently, the code is being revised for a better distribution,
integration, and future development.
