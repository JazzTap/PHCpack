The code is developed on the NVIDIA K20C with g++ and the CUDA SDK.
It requires the QD and the GQD libraries.

The subdirectories, in alphabetical order are as follows:

bin           : for standalone binaries, apart from the PHCv2/bin
Complex       : tempated C++ code for complex arithmetic
Objects       : contains makefiles and .o files
DefineTypesD  : headers specific for double precision
DefineTypesDD : headers specific for double double precision
DefineTypesQD : headers specific for quad double precision
Main          : main programs
Path_CPU      : path tracking on the host, the CPU
Path_GPU      : path tracking on the device, the GPU
Poly          : defines data structures for polynomials
Test          : code to link with PHClib

The standalone binaries are designed for benchmarking purposes
and work in several modes.
