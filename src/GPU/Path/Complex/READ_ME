Complex arithmetic for the Path library in PHCv2.3.34.

Definitions of complex types and arithmetic, with templates,
ready for double, double double, and quad double precision.

Header files end with the extension .h, c++ end with .cpp,
and code for the device ends with .cu (short for CUDA).
The big 'H' stands for Host.

Type 'make test_complexH' to build a simple program to test
the complex arithmetic on the host.

The GQD library is the version of the QD library for GPUs
and types on the host are different from types on the device.
The utilities gqd_qd_util provide functions to convert from
tuples on the device into types on the host.
