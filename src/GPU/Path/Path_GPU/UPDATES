Mon 17 Aug 2015 : newton_single2() had to be used in newton.cu,
  with more upgrades for the evaluation and differentiation.

Thu 2 Jul 2015 : in newton.cu, changed on line 1239, the call to newton()
  into the call to newton_single().

Mon 29 Jun 2015 : in eval.cu, removed the comment on line 4,
  before the statement #include "eval_mon_dd.cu", so eval.cu compiles
  to make path_dd.
