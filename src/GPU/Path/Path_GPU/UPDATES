Thu 3 Sep 2015 : added verbose option to GPU_Newton in newton.cu and
  set the debug to false to mute the execution of Newton's method on the GPU.
  This verbose option is also added to the prototype in path_gpu.h.

Wed 2 Sep 2015 : updated path_gpu_data.h, path_gpu_data.cu, path_gpu.cu,
  and newton.cu.

Fri 21 Aug 2015 : added verbose option to path_gpu_mult.cu and path_gpu.cu,
  reformatted path_gpu_data.h and muted cuda_set.cu.
  Turned off debug option in newton.cu to make it silent.

Thu 20 Aug 2015 : reformatted code in path_gpu.cu and path_multi_gpu.cu.

Mon 17 Aug 2015 : newton_single2() had to be used in newton.cu,
  with more upgrades for the evaluation and differentiation.

Thu 2 Jul 2015 : in newton.cu, changed on line 1239, the call to newton()
  into the call to newton_single().

Mon 29 Jun 2015 : in eval.cu, removed the comment on line 4,
  before the statement #include "eval_mon_dd.cu", so eval.cu compiles
  to make path_dd.
